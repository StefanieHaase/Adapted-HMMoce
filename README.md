# Adapted-HMMoce
R script for the adapted HMMoce geolocation framework for the paper "Validation approaches of a geolocation model to reconstruct movements of demersal fish equipped with data storage tags in a stratified environment"

All code is based on the HMMoce (https://github.com/camrinbraun/HMMoce) and adapted to use for cod in the southern Baltic Sea tagged with star-oddi temperature-depth DSTs. We use a Baltic ROM containing temperature-depth data in a .ncdf4 format

The "Geolocation_artificialtrack_GER.R" code is an example on how to reconstruct the track of a simulated track starting close to the island of RÃ¼gen in German waters, swimming to the Bornholm Basin and returning to the Arkona Basin (B2222_noise2.csv).
